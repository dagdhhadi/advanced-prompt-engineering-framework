# Advanced Prompt Engineering Framework

This project demonstrates a structured prompt engineering framework designed to improve the reliability, clarity, and usefulness of large language model (LLM) outputs.

## Objective
To show how prompt structure, constraints, and reasoning strategies significantly improve AI responses compared to vague prompts.

## Core Prompt Framework
A reusable prompt structure that defines:
- Role
- Task
- Context
- Constraints
- Reasoning Strategy
- Evaluation Criteria
- Output Format

## Use Case 1: AI Resume Optimization
This use case compares a weak prompt with an optimized prompt for improving resumes targeted at AI and prompt engineering roles.

The optimized prompt produces:
- Structured output
- Role-specific feedback
- Actionable improvements

## Skills Demonstrated
- Prompt design
- Prompt optimization
- AI reasoning control
- Output evaluation
